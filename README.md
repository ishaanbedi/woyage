## Using Woyage.app

The easiest way to use Woyage is to use the already deployed version at [woyage.app](https://woyage.app/).

When you visit the website, you can sign up for an account and add your website to start tracking your visitors. You will be provided with a tracking code that you can add to your website to start tracking visitors.

## Running Woyage Locally

If you want to run Woyage locally, you can follow the steps below:

Before you start, you need to setup a Supabase project. You can sign up for a free account at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

### Supabase Schema

There are three tables in the Supabase database to facilitate the tracking of visitors:

1. **site_domains**: This table stores the domains of the websites that are being tracked, and has the following columns:
   - **id**: Auto-incrementing ID.
   - **domain_name**: The domain name of the website, unique and binded to the user.
   - **email**: The email of the user who added the domain, used for authentication and authorization for the domain.
   - **website_id**: The ID of the website, used to track visitors, used as a foreign key in other related tables.
   - **added_timestamp**: The timestamp when the domain was added, used for displaying in the dashboard in a sorted manner.

Execute the following SQL query in Supabase's SQL editor to create the `site_domains` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS site_domains (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  domain_name text,
  email varchar(250),
  website_id uuid,
  added_time timestamp with time zone
);
```

2.  **analytics**: This table stores the visitor data, and has the following columns:

    - **id**: The ID of the website, which is the same as the `website_id` in the `site_domains` table.
    - **path**: The path of the page visited by the visitor.
    - **browser**: The browser used by the visitor.
    - **device**: The device used by the visitor.
    - **language**: The language spoken by the visitor.
    - **referrer**: The referrer of the visitor.
    - **os**: The operating system used by the visitor's device.
    - **country**: The country of the visitor.
    - **website_id**: The ID of the website, can be used interchangeably with the `id` column, but is not used to relate to the `site_domains` table.
    - **domain**: The domain of the website, used to identify the website, and prevent unauthorized tracking.
    - **timestamp**: The timestamp when the visitor visited the website, used to track the time of the visit.

Execute the following SQL query in Supabase's SQL editor to create the `analytics` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS analytics (
  id uuid,
  path text,
  browser text,
  device text,
  language text,
  referrer text,
  os text,
  country text,
  website_id uuid,
  domain text,
  timestamp timestamp with time zone
);
```

3. **contacts**: This table stores the support requests from the visitors, and has the following columns:
   - **id**: Auto-incrementing ID.
   - **name**: The name of the visitor.
   - **email**: The email of the visitor.
   - **query_type**: The type of query, like a bug report, feature request, etc.
   - **message**: The message sent by the visitor.
   - **created_at**: The timestamp when the support request was created.

Execute the following SQL query in Supabase's SQL editor to create the `contacts` table:

```sql
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS contacts (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name text,
      email text,
      query_type text,
      message text,
      created_at timestamp with time zone
    );

```

The `contacts` table is used to store the support requests from the visitors, and is used to send emails to the admin when a new support request is created. In case you don't want to implement support, you can ignore the `contacts` table and the related code in the Supabase functions, and the Supabase Webhooks.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishaanbedi/woyage
```

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the environment variables as per the following:

```bash

# Name of your website
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME="Woyage"

# URL of your website
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="https://woyage.app/"

# Stage of your website (development/production) used to determine the environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_STAGE="development"

# Get this from your Supabase project settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="..."

 # Get this from your Supabase project settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://project_id.supabase.co"

# We are using Resend for everything related to emails, you need to sign up on Resend and set up a domain over there & setup the Supabase integration. Check out the following links for more information:
# https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction
# https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/resend
# https://resend.com/api-keys

# After setting up the domain, set the RESEND_EMAIL variable
RESEND_EMAIL="re_..."

# Support email for your website, remove this if you don't plan to implement support
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL="support@woyage.app"

# Woyage use Supabase Webhooks to email the admin whenever a new support request is created. You can set a webhook in your Supabase project settings:
# https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/webhooks

# When you create a webhook, create a HEADER with a key as `supabase-verified` and a value that will be used to verify it, and set the following environment variable with the value you've set, in order to prevent unauthorized requests to your webhook
SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_HEADER_KEY="...."

# Email of the recipient of the support requests, remove this if you don't plan to implement support
SUPPORT_RECIPIENT="hey@ishaanbedi.com"

```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploying Woyage

Deploying Woyage is easy, just follow the steps mentioned in the [Running Woyage Locally](#running-woyage-locally) section to set up the Supabase database and environment variables.

After that, you can easily deploy Woyage to Vercel by clicking the button below:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fishaanbedi%2Fwoyage%2F&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME,NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_STAGE,NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,RESEND_EMAIL,NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL,SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_HEADER_KEY,SUPPORT_RECIPIENT&project-name=woyage&repository-name=woyage)

## Support Mechanism

Woyage has a built-in support mechanism that allows visitors to send support requests to the admin. The support requests are stored in the `contacts` table in the Supabase database, and the admin is notified via email whenever a new support request is created.

Here's how the support mechanism works:

1. The visitor fills out the support form on the website.
2. Using Supabase JavaScript SDK, the support request is added to the `contacts` table in the Supabase database.
3. Based on the insert operation in the `contacts` table, a Supabase webhook is triggered.
4. The Supabase webhook sends a POST request to the `/api/support-email` endpoint in the application.
5. The webhook is configured with a header key that is used to verify the request, in order to prevent unauthorized requests to the endpoint.
6. The `/api/support-email` further triggers the Resend API to send an email to the admin with the details of the support request.

This ensures that the admin is notified whenever a new support request is created, and can respond to the visitor accordingly.
