      <h1>{appName} Privacy Policy</h1>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        At {appName}, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring
        the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains
        how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use
        our website and services.
      </p>
      <p>I have tried my best to keep it simple and easy to understand.</p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        As the intent of {appName} is to provide analytics services, we have to
        collect some information from you and your website. This information may
        include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Usage information: Browser type, device information, operating
            system, country the user is from, language the user uses, paths of
            your website they visit, and the referral source. Nothing from this
            can be used to identify an individual, keeping it safe and secure.
            <br />
            We collect the user-agent string from the browser, which is a string
            that looks like:
            <br />
            <code>
              Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
              (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3
            </code>
            <br />
            You can see that it does not contain any personal information and
            all the information is about the browser and the device.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cookies: No cookies are stored on your visitors' devices. We use
            cookies to store your session information and to keep you logged in,
            that too is managed by Supabase (our backend and database provider).
          </li>
          <strong className="font-bold">
            We do not collect any personal information from your visitors.
